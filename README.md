Brief Explanation of the Project Work:
In this project, I was provided with a skeleton code that included the environment setup and initial classes for building the agent's brain. The code used Python, TensorFlow, and Keras libraries to create a maze environment and an intelligent agent (the pirate) that navigates through it. I was responsible for implementing the core Q-learning algorithm to make the agent learn the most efficient paths in the maze.
The following code is what I did myself;

Connection to the Larger Field of Computer Science:
What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems using computational methods and algorithms. In today's data-driven world, computer science plays a crucial role in advancements in fields ranging from healthcare and finance to entertainment and social interaction. The ability to analyze data, design algorithms, and create effective software solutions is indispensable.

How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?:
The first step in approaching a problem involves understanding its requirements and constraints. Once the problem is clearly defined, various algorithms and data structures are considered to come up with an efficient solution. Throughout this project, I applied these principles by implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve the maze navigation problem.

Ethical Responsibilities to the End-User and the Organization:
As a computer scientist, ethical considerations are paramount. When developing software or algorithms, it's essential to ensure the privacy and security of end-users. The solutions must be reliable and tested rigorously to minimize errors or unintended consequences. Transparency with stakeholders and end-users about the capabilities and limitations of the software is also vital.
